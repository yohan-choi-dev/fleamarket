# Fleamarket

## Motivation

Fleamarket was the graudation project. Whenever I used Kijiji, I felt uncomfortable for its limited functionality. The main movitation of the application was providing simple and fast trading service. Fleamarket is E-commerse platform that allows local people exchange thier goods easily. It is a web application that supports responsive web design. 

## Technologies

The main point of this application is a real-time user interaction. To implement the functionality, we used web-socket since it effectively duplex communication.
